## Problem Description
#### A robot named "Robby" who lives in a (computer simulated, but messy) two-dimensional world that is strewn with empty soda cans. Robby's job is to clean up his world by collecting the empty soda cans. Robby' s world, consists of 100 squares (sites) laid out in a 10Ã—10 grid, and there is a wall around the boundary of the entire grid. Various sites have been littered with soda cans (but with no more than one can per site). From wherever he is, he can see the contents of one adjacent site in the north, south, east, and west directions, as well as the contents of the site he occupies. A site can be empty, contain a can, or be a wall.
#### For each cleaning session, Robby can perform exactly 100 operations. Each operation consists of one of the following seven choices: move to the north, move to the south, move to the east, move to the west, choose a random direction to move in, stay put, or bend down to pick up a can.
